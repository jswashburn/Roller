# Roller
My second unity game ðŸ˜„

This is a game where you play as a spherical character and roll your way through obstacles and challenges in order to get points and rewards. I just started this one and I'm excited to see where it ends up. I think a lot of the inspiration is going to come from Temple Run.

This time around I decided to use my own 3d models. I've been learning blender (and having lots of fun doing so) so I figured I would model my own character skins, environment stuff, and props.

Some things I'm currently working on:
* A working infinite-scrolling track that does not create/destroy large amounts of game objects, but rather using object pooling (a concept I'm still investigating and learning about)
* Using the particle system to have asteroids in the background
* Thinking in general about gameplay ideas and progression
* Refining movement, getting it to feel right
