# Roller
My second unity game ðŸ˜„

This is a game where you play as a spherical character and roll your way through obstacles and challenges in order to get points and rewards. I just started this one and I'm excited to see where it ends up. I think a lot of the inspiration is going to come from Temple Run.

This time around I decided to use *my own 3d models*. I've been learning blender (and having lots of fun doing so) so I figured I would model my own character skins, environment stuff, and props.

## Some things I'm currently working on:
<dl>
  
  <dt>Infinite-scrolling track</dt>
  <dd>
    Trying to create an infinite scrolling track with animations, but instead of creating and destroying game objects I want to use object pooling (a concept I'm still investigating and learning about)
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Asteroids</dt>
  <dd>
    Using the particle system to have asteroids in the background
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Gameplay loop</dt>
  <dd>
    Thinking in general about how the game is going to play out, new gameplay ideas, progression ideas
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Movement</dt>
  <dd>
    Refining the player movement, getting movement to feel right and fun
  </dd>
