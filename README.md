My second unity game ðŸ˜„

This is a game where you play as a spherical character and roll your way through obstacles and challenges in order to get points and rewards. I just started this one and I'm excited to see where it ends up. I think a lot of the inspiration is going to come from Temple Run.

This time around I decided to use *my own 3d models*. I've been learning blender (and having lots of fun doing so) so I figured I would model my own character skins, environment stuff, and props.

## Some things I'm currently working on:
<dl>
  
  <dt>Infinite-scrolling track</dt>
  <dd>
    Adding more track pieces. Different pieces will vary in appearance and functionality. Some will be extra bouncy and some will kill the player
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Asteroids / Space debris</dt>
  <dd>
    Modeling and adding more asteroids, as well as a few other space debris things
  </dd>
  
  <dt>New gameplay elements</dt>
  <dd>
    At the moment, you can roll along a track and collect items, fall off the track and start over.
    I need some more gameplay elements. Here's what I'm thinking:
    <ul>
      <li> An enemy that follows you and shoots at you </li>
      <li> A shop allowing you to buy skins with your hard earned coins </li>
      <li> Obstacles on the track </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Enemy</dt>
  <dd>
    Modeling, considering mechanics
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Movement</dt>
  <dd>
    Refining the player movement, getting movement to feel less sluggish
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd>
    I need a better title than "Roller"
  </dd>
</dl>
