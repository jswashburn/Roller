# Roller
My second unity game ðŸ˜„

This is a game where you play as a spherical character and roll your way through obstacles and challenges in order to get points and rewards. I just started this one and I'm excited to see where it ends up. I think a lot of the inspiration is going to come from Temple Run.

This time around I decided to use *my own 3d models*. I've been learning blender (and having lots of fun doing so) so I figured I would model my own character skins, environment stuff, and props.

## Some things I'm currently working on:
<dl>
  
  <dt>Infinite-scrolling track</dt>
  <dd>
    The infinite scrolling track works, now it's just a matter of creating more track pieces in blender. The next step is to make it work with other objects, like collectable items. I also need to add some variation in the spawn height of the pieces, so the player isn't constantly moving in a straight line.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Asteroids / Space debris</dt>
  <dd>
    Asteroid particles are working, now just need to add some more asteroid meshes so they don't all look the same. Going to add a few more things as well, like sattelites.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Gameplay loop</dt>
  <dd>
    Thinking in general about how the game is going to play out, new gameplay ideas, progression ideas. The main idea is this: Run away from the thing chasing you for as long as possible, collect coins along the way, and purchase new skins with your coins.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Enemy</dt>
  <dd>
    Need to come up with an enemy that will chase the player.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Movement</dt>
  <dd>
    Refining the player movement, getting movement to feel right and fun.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Title</dt>
  <dd>
    Title could use some work. Need ideas, but we'll see once more game is developed
  </dd>
